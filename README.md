# metaPhosphosites
 The collection of scripts in this repository are used to generate structural annotation of phoshphoryaltion sites from PDBs. The following steps include the workflow
1. Gather PDBs for for proteins of interest - getPDBs.py
2. Evaluate PDB quality - Extract_pdbheaders.py, 
3. Annotate functional domains on proteins - extract_uniprot_Domain_annotations.py
4. Map functional domains and phosphosites on PDBs -
